## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Hadionly/task-management.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd task-management
   ```
3. Install dependencies and json-server:
   ```sh
   npm install
   npm install -g json-server
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```sh
   npx expo start
   ```

## Setting up JSON Server and Open AI

1. Install JSON Server globally:

   ```sh
   npm install -g json-server
   ```

2. Find your IPv4 address, run the following command:

   ```sh
   ipconfig
   ```

   Look for "IPv4 Address" under your network adapter (usually starts with 192.168.x.x)

3. Update config file:
   Go to `../config/api.config.ts`:

   ```typescript
   export const API_CONFIG = {
     OPENAI_API_KEY: "API_KEY", // Replace with OpenAI Key
     IPV4_ADDRESS: "YOUR_IPV4_ADDRESS", // Replace with your IPv4
   };
   ```

   Replace YOUR_IPV4_ADDRESS with the address found in step 2
   And API_KEY with OpenAI Key

4. Start JSON Server:
   ```sh
   json-server db.json --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0
   ```

Note: Your mobile device/emulator must be on the same network as your development machine.
